### What is the project about? ❓

Coffeez, my Coffee e-commerce project built with next.js during the upLeveled bootcamp, provides a wide selection of coffee varieties to users. By exploring the store page, users can choose products, navigate to dedicated pages for more information, modify quantities in the basket, view the total amount, and complete the checkout process to complete their purchase.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### How to start? 🤔

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
